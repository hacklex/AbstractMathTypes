# AbstractMathTypes

This is my first F# project, in which I learn F# by implementing
the most basic data types to be used in a CAS.

So far, I've implemented group, ring, and a polynomial ring.

I intend to extend this to actually implement at least the extended Euclidean algorithm
(and the data types needed for it to work).

I intend to gradually learn F# as I add more and more stuff here.
